# Noorvia AI Enhancement - AI-Generated Responses & Branding Update

## 🚀 **Problem Solved: Same Results Issue**

### **Root Cause:**

```javascript
// OLD: Multiple fallback checks first
if (scenario) { ... }
else if (commonQuestion) { ... }
else if (serviceInquiry) { ... }
else { aiResponse = await sendMessageToGemini(inputMessage); }

// NEW: Always try AI first
try {
  aiResponse = await sendMessageToGemini(inputMessage);

  // Only use fallbacks if AI completely fails
}
